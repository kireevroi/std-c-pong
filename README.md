# PONG
This is a training project.
## Description

This is an implementation of a simple pong game using only std C libraries.
The controls are A/Z to move the left raquet and K/M for the right.
Space moves time forward.
Due to the nature of this project: 'enter' needs to be pressed after every entry.
Scores go to 21.
